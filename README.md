# Toolbox
This is my personal project, developing simple methods, and algorithms, to use in my future project 
either with this library as a dependency or just to copy the code from it

The idea is all of these methods should be well JUnit tested pure functions, so there is no way
a bug could get further into any projects using this

Feel free to use this library, or just copy the code from it yourself
